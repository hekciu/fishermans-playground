Current goals:
- Fix issue with linking raylib.h (linking raymath works :)
- Why do I need to call 'make clean' two times to delete engine/*.o files?
- Create basic window with background and fullscreen options
- <DONE> Overall setup for windows
- <DONE> Integrate MinGW for windows compilation
- <DONE> Link Raylib with renderer

Principles:
- Raylib should be only used inside 'engine' abstraction layer
